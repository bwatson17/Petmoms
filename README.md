My partner, Shakira Perry, and I, Bailey Watson have created a website for the local business, Tail Wagger'z. Tail Wagger's is a local all natural food store in Jackson, TN. We both strive to become more advanced in building a website and wish to go even further.

Our Website was created to allow people to keep up with the store, read what Tail Wagger'z is all about and keep up with current events. Our website contains the information that would typically be searched for by a potential customer. 

Website Features:
     Our website allows the potential customers to be able to see the upcomming events that will be happening at Tail Wagger'z. 
     Tail Wagger'z is very active on Facebook but to make the website morte interactive Shakira and I decided that it woud make sense to have a "Leave a Message" section where you can leave them a message and they will be able to respond the the inquiring customer. 
     In our "Contact Us" section wee have inserted their phone number, email, adress, and work hours.


My partner and I have tried to make our website transfer from Cloud9, but unfortunatly it will not tranfer correctly and we cannot find the issue. so you may need to download our website. I apologize for this major inconvenience.
